Booking Code Challenge
==

Problem definition
---

We own an apartment and we’re renting it through different popular web sites. Before
actually renting the apartment for some days, those platforms send us booking requests. We
want to get insights from those booking requests in order to make better decisions. For
instance, we’d like to know what’s the profit per night we’re getting and what could be the
best combination of bookings to maximize our profits.
We will create an API for this purpose.
